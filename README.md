# Laboratory work on the course "Computer image processing" implemented in C#

Tasks for laboratory work:

## Laboratory work No. 1:
Blending two 8 bpp images of the same size using the third 8 bpp image as the alpha channel. Implement mirror image pixels relative to the vertical axis, horizontal axis, as well as image transposition.

## Laboratory work No. 2:
Implement the calculation of the histogram of brightness, mean, variance, entropy, energy (uniformity), asymmetry coefficients and kurtosis. Implement the calculation of the co-occurrence matrix for pixels spaced r rows and columns away. Calculate the energy of the co-occurrence matrix.

## Laboratory work No. 3:
Implement rotation of the image at an arbitrary angle using bicubic interpolation.

## Laboratory work No. 4:
Implement image conversion of 8 bpp to n bpp (n < 8) using the Floyd-Stenberg error spreading algorithm. A simplified implementation is allowed, in which the result is stored in the form of 8 bpp, but each pixel can have only one of 2 valid values.

## Laboratory work No. 5:
Implement two-dimensional convolution of the image. The convolution core is user-defined. Using this function, make a low-pass filter, high-pass filter and a sharpening filter.

## Laboratory work No. 6:
Implement ranked image filtering. Filter aperture is user defined.

## Laboratory work No. 7:
Implement threshold binarization of the image, marking of 4 connected areas, calculation for the regions of geometric moments of the 0th and 1st orders and central geometric moments of the 2nd order.
